[SOME NOTES AND GENERAL EXPLANATIONS]

IMPORTANT: NO MORE THAN 80 CHARACTERS PER LINE IN THIS FILE. IN SRC FILES WE
  ARE NOT SO STRICT ABOUT THIS LIMIT, BUT APPLY IT WHEN IT'S "EASY"*!
  * YOU DECIDE WHAT IS "EASY" =P

NOTE¹: after something is done, move to DONE if it still requires an update in
  the tex file. If it's already in the tex, just remove it from this file.
NOTE²: do not remove old code/reference files; move to _unused/.
NOTE³: if you have a draft of some algorithm (incomplete code or needs review, 
  testing, etc) add it to _draft/ until it's complete.

NAMING:
  = ds_<data structure>.cpp/.py
  = al_<algorithm>.cpp/.py
  = rf_<reference>.cpp/.py/.tex/.txt
      i.e. if it's a reference to C++, use .cpp, even if it's not code.
  - If something fits both algorithm and data structure (like suffix array),
    you may choose whatever you prefer.
  - Avoid pseudocode (use python instead) unless it looks better (like hstring)
