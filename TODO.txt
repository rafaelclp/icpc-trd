[SOME NOTES AND GENERAL EXPLANATIONS]

IMPORTANT: NO MORE THAN 80 CHARACTERS PER LINE IN THIS FILE. AVOID OVER 80
  CHARACTERS PER LINE IN SRC FILES.

NOTES:
  - After something is done, move to DONE if it still requires an update in
    the tex file. If it's already in the tex, just remove it from this file.
  - Do not remove old code/reference files; move to _unused/. Rename if needed.
  - If you have a draft of some algorithm (incomplete code or needs review,
    testing, etc) add it to _draft/ until it's complete.
  - If you made modifications to some src file and didn't test them, but think
    it still works, keep it in src/ but add an entry here in RETEST.

NAMING CONVENTIONS:
  = al_<algorithm>.cpp/.py
  = ds_<data structure>.cpp/.py
  = cd_<piece of code>.cpp/.py
  = rf_<reference>.cpp/.py/.tex/.txt
      i.e. if it's a reference to C++, use .cpp, even if it's not code.
  - If something fits both algorithm and data structure (like suffix array),
    you may choose whatever you prefer.
  - Avoid pseudocode (use python instead) unless it looks better (like hstring)
